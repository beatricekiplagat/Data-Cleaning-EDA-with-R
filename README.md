#### 8/25/2021 

### Description

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. 
She currently targets audiences originating from various countries.
In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ my services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

The following are our metrics for success: 

- Cleaned data.
- Graphical representation of the relationships in the data as well as the distributions f the different variables in the data.
- Sound conclusions and recommendations to the client as per the analysis done.

The steps taken during this study are:

- Loading the data & needed packages.
- Exploring the dataset.
- Cleaning the data.
- Feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Conclusions.
- Recommendations.
